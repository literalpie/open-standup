import { PersonStatus } from "../../components/person-status/person-status";
import Readme from "../../../README.md";

This is test documentation using MDX!

Here's the component:

```JSX
<PersonStatus name="Ben" done current={false} />
```

<PersonStatus name="Ben" done current={false} />

Here's the readme ⬇️ (sorry there's a duplicate header ).
But it's cool I can import that and show it here!
