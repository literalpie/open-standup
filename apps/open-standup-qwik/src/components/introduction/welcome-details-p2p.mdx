When using the p2p (peer-to-peer) version of the app, the information is not stored on any server.
It is sent from your browser to the browser of anyone viewing the same meeting.

The state of the meeting is also saved locally. This means if you
close the page and come back later in the same browser, you can pick
up where you left off. However, if anyone visits the page in a
different browser that hasn't already been synced and there isn't
anyone currently "hosting" the updated meeting, they will start with a
new meeting.
